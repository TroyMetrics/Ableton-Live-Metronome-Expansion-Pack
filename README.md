# Installation

Optional: Follow this [Video](https://youtu.be/JeTm7GRaG04?si=yNAQV6L2B6bzEx0N&t=65) or,

1. Download and Extract "Professional Metronomes for Ableton Live.zip" file to your computer.

2. Open the newly extracted folder to view the contents, then Open the "Ableton Live Metronomes" folder.

3. Copy and Paste the contents of the "Ableton Live Metronomes" folder into Ableton Live's "Metronome" folder located at:

%PROGRAMDATA%\Ableton\Live 11 Suite\Resources\Misc\Metronome

You can copy/paste this file location into the Windows File Explorer address bar if necessary. Note that \Live 11 Suite may vary dependent on which version you have.

4. Restart Ableton Live for changes to take effect.

5. Access Metronomes: Find the new high-quality metronomes in Ableton's metronome drop-down menu from the metronome icon.

6. Enjoy! :)

Note - There's no requirement to overwrite Ableton's default metronome sound files, as suggested in numerous tutorials. Instead, metronomes are simply added to the drop down list within Ableton, and Ableton's original metronomes remain functional.

üõ†Ô∏è I plan to release full Mac support in a future update. In the meantime, I‚Äôve included the project file so Mac users can save the .adg files themselves. If you‚Äôre a Mac user and would like to help improve Mac compatibility, please get in touch!
